# react-native-onfoot

Yet another pedometer support for react native.
The goal of this library is to provide maximum configuration options for both platforms.
Currently no expo support is provided - expo has it's own library for pedometer support.

This library supports the `date` parameter of `CMPedometer.startUpdates` in iOS.
